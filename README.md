 # Remote Camera Pod
 A 2015 experiment in remotely controlling cameras for HDRunners.com
 This was my first project working with Python back in 2015. 
 It may still prove useful, so putting it here just in case.
It provides a mouse-click GUI (with Tkinter) for sending LANC commands <sup>1<\sup> to a Canon G30 camcorder for:
 zoom (1X to 20X), start/stop recording, cam wake/sleep

 Could implement:
 * faster, easier user-control (keyboard or other?)
 * manual/auto focus
 * remote client over SSH
 * saving a user-defined "home" configuration to return to quickly when requested
 * stepper motors to pan and tilt
